- **‚ö° Real-time Proxy**: High-performance request interception and forwarding
- **üí∞ Multi-Network Support**: USDC payments on Base, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks
- **üõ°Ô∏è Escrow System**: Configurable hold periods with automated dispute resolution
- **üìä Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time revenue, conversion, and performance metrics

## üß™ Testing

Follow our comprehensive [Testing Guide](./TESTING_GUIDE.md) to validate all platform features:

1. **Authentication** - User registration and login
2. **Endpoint Configuration** - Service and API endpoint setup
3. **Payment Enforcement** - HTTP 402 response validation
4. **Payment Processing** - Mock and real payment flows
5. **Analytics** - Real-time metrics verification
6. **Compliance** - Geo-blocking and filtering tests
7. **Escrow** - Payment holding and release mechanisms

### Quick Test Example
```bash
# Test unpaid request (should return HTTP 402)
curl -v "http://localhost:5000/proxy/your-org-id/your-service-id/endpoint"

# Test with payment proof (should forward to origin)
curl -v "http://localhost:5000/proxy/your-org-id/your-service-id/endpoint" \
  -H "x402-payment-hash: your-transaction-hash"
```

### x402 Protocol Implementation

PayGate implements the x402 payment protocol specification:

1. **Unpaid Request**: Returns HTTP 402 with payment quote
2. **Payment Quote**: Signed quote with price, networks, and expiry
3. **Payment Verification**: Validates blockchain transaction proof
4. **Request Forwarding**: Proxies to origin API after payment confirmation

Example 402 Response:
```json
{
  "error": "Payment Required",
  "quote": {
    "id": "quote_123",
    "price": "0.10",
    "currency": "USDC",
    "networks": ["base", "ethereum"],
    "expires": "2025-01-16T12:00:00Z",
    "signature": "0x..."
  }
}
```
