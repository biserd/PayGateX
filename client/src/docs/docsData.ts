        content: `# About PayGate x402

PayGate x402 is a sophisticated payment proxy platform that implements the x402 payment protocol for APIs, allowing developers to monetize their API endpoints through automated micropayments.

## What is x402?

The x402 payment protocol extends HTTP with payment requirements. When an API endpoint requires payment, it responds with HTTP status code 402 (Payment Required) along with payment instructions. Once payment is verified, the request proceeds to the target API.

## Platform Architecture

**Payment Flow:**
1. API request ‚Üí PayGate x402 proxy
2. Check payment requirements
3. If unpaid ‚Üí Return 402 with signed quote
4. If paid ‚Üí Verify payment ‚Üí Forward to API
5. Return API response to client

## Key Features

- **x402 Protocol Implementation**: Full HTTP 402 payment protocol support
- **Multi-Network Support**: Base, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive usage tracking and revenue reporting
- **Compliance Controls**: Geographic restrictions and IP filtering
- **Escrow System**: Time-based payment holds with dispute resolution
- **Free Tier Management**: Configurable free request limits
- **Facilitator Adapters**: Pluggable payment verification (Coinbase, x402.rs, Mock)

## What makes PayGate x402 unique?

- **Protocol-Native**: Built specifically for the x402 payment protocol

   - \`endpoint_path\`: Your endpoint path (e.g., \`cats\`, \`fact\`, etc.)

## Test 1: Unpaid Request (Should Get HTTP 402)

**Request Setup:**
- **Method**: GET (or your endpoint's method)
- **URL**: \`{{base_url}}/proxy/{{org_id}}/{{service_id}}/{{endpoint_path}}\`
- **Headers**: None needed for first test

**Expected Response:**
- **Status**: 402 Payment Required
- **Body**: x402 protocol compliant JSON:

\`\`\`json
{
  "x402Version": 1,
  "accepts": [{
    "scheme": "exact",
    "network": "base",
    "maxAmountRequired": "500", 
    "resource": "/demo-org-1/demo-service-1/api/v1/cats",
    "description": "API access",
    "payTo": "demo-org-1",
    "asset": "0x833589fCD6eDb6E08f4c7C32D4f71b54bdA02913"
  }]
}
\`\`\`

**Postman Test Script:**

\`\`\`javascript
pm.test("Status is 402", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(402);
});

pm.test("Response has quote header", function () {
    const quoteHeader = pm.response.headers.get("X-402-QUOTE");
    pm.expect(quoteHeader).to.not.be.null;
    
    // Decode the base64 quote
    const quoteData = JSON.parse(atob(quoteHeader));
    pm.expect(quoteData).to.have.property('nonce');
    
    // Save quote nonce as quote ID for next request
    pm.collectionVariables.set("quote_id", quoteData.nonce);
    pm.collectionVariables.set("quote_signature", quoteData.signature);
});
\`\`\`

## Test 2: Simulate Payment (Development Only)

**Request Setup:**
- **Method**: POST
- **URL**: \`{{base_url}}/api/payments/simulate\`
- **Headers**: 
  - \`Content-Type\`: \`application/json\`
- **Body** (raw JSON):

\`\`\`json
{
  "endpointId": "endpoint-1",
  "amount": "0.001"
}
\`\`\`

**Expected Response:**
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Body**: Payment simulation success

## Test 3: Paid Request (Should Get API Response)

**Request Setup:**
- **Method**: GET (same as Test 1)
- **URL**: \`{{base_url}}/proxy/{{org_id}}/{{service_id}}/{{endpoint_path}}\`
- **Headers**:
  - \`x-payment\`: \`{{simulated_tx_hash}}\` (from Test 2)
  - \`x-payer-address\`: \`0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0\`

**Expected Response:**
- **Status**: 200 OK
- **Body**: Actual API response from target service

**Postman Test Script:**

\`\`\`javascript
pm.test("Status is 200", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});

pm.test("Response contains API data", function () {
    const responseJson = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(responseJson).to.be.an('object');
});
\`\`\`

## Automated Test Collection

Create a complete collection with environment variables and automated test scripts:

### Environment Variables

\`\`\`json
{
  "base_url": "http://localhost:5000",
  "org_id": "demo-org",
  "service_id": "demo-service", 
  "wallet_address": "0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0"
}
\`\`\`

### Pre-request Scripts

\`\`\`javascript
// Generate unique request ID for testing
pm.collectionVariables.set("request_id", pm.globals.replaceIn('{{$guid}}'));

// Set timestamp
pm.collectionVariables.set("timestamp", new Date().toISOString());
\`\`\`

### Collection Runner

1. **Set up test data**: Create multiple test cases with different endpoints
2. **Run collection**: Execute all tests in sequence
3. **Generate report**: Export results for documentation
4. **CI/CD integration**: Use Newman for automated testing

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**402 Response Missing Headers**
- Check endpoint configuration
- Verify pricing is set
- Confirm network settings

**Payment Verification Fails**
- Validate transaction hash format
- Check payer address matches
- Verify network (sandbox vs mainnet)

**API Not Forwarding**
- Check target URL is accessible
- Verify endpoint path mapping
- Review proxy configuration

### Debug Tips

1. **Enable Verbose Logging**: Check server logs for detailed error messages
2. **Test Direct API**: Bypass PayGate to test target API directly
3. **Check Network**: Ensure correct blockchain network is configured
4. **Validate Headers**: Use Postman console to inspect all headers

  - Connect wallet and claim test ETH
- **Test USDC**: Get Base Sepolia USDC
  - Contract: 0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e
  - Use Base Sepolia faucets or bridge small amounts

## Testing with PayGate x402

### 1. Enable Sandbox Mode

\`\`\`bash
# Ensure sandbox mode is enabled (Base Sepolia)
curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5000/api/organization/sandbox" \\
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
  -d '{"sandboxMode": true}'
\`\`\`

### 2. Get Payment Quote

\`\`\`bash
# Request x402 quote for Base Sepolia
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/proxy/demo-org/demo-service/api/v1/cats"
\`\`\`

**Expected Response:**

\`\`\`json
{
  "error": "Payment required",
  "amount": "0.01",
  "currency": "USDC", 
  "network": "base-sepolia",
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0",
  "quote_id": "quote_abc123"
}
\`\`\`

### 3. Make USDC Payment

Using your wallet:
1. **Recipient**: Use the \`payTo\` address from the quote
2. **Amount**: Convert from the quote (e.g., "500" = 0.0005 USDC)
3. **Network**: Base Sepolia (Chain ID: 84532)
4. **Token**: USDC (0x036CbD53842c5426634e7929541eC2318f3dCF7e)

### 4. Test API with Payment Proof

\`\`\`bash
# Use the transaction hash from your USDC transfer
curl -s "http://localhost:5000/proxy/demo-org/demo-service/api/v1/cats" \\
  -H "x-payment: YOUR_TX_HASH" \\
  -H "x-payer-address: YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS"
\`\`\`

## Wallet Address Configuration

### For Organizations
The organization's wallet address is configured in the database as the \`payTo\` field. This is where USDC payments are sent.

### For Users (Payers)
Users provide their wallet address in the \`x-payer-address\` header when making payments. This identifies who made the payment.

## Example Test Flow

1. **Get Quote**: Request shows Base Sepolia network and USDC amount
2. **Send USDC**: Transfer required amount to organization's address  
3. **Get Transaction Hash**: Copy from wallet or block explorer
4. **Test Access**: Use transaction hash to access protected API
5. **Verify**: Check Base Sepolia block explorer for transaction

## Network Configuration

- **Sandbox Mode**: Base Sepolia (testnet)
  - Safe for testing with small amounts
  - Same interface as mainnet
  - No real financial risk

- **Production Mode**: Base Mainnet
  - Real USDC transactions
  - Actual financial cost
  - Full production environment

## Verification Steps

### 1. Check Transaction Status

Visit [Base Sepolia Explorer](https://sepolia.basescan.org) and search for your transaction hash to confirm:
- Transaction was successful
- Correct amount was sent
- Correct recipient address
- USDC token transfer occurred

### 2. Verify PayGate Processing

Check PayGate logs for:
- Payment verification attempt
- Facilitator response
- Usage record creation
- API forwarding success

### 3. Validate Analytics

In the PayGate dashboard:
- Revenue should increase by payment amount
- Request count should increment
- Usage records should show \`paid\` status
- Network should display \`base-sepolia\`

## Troubleshooting

### Payment Not Recognized

**Symptoms**: API still returns 402 despite payment
**Solutions**:
- Verify transaction hash is correct
- Check payer address matches exactly
- Confirm payment amount meets minimum
- Wait for blockchain confirmation

### Wrong Network

**Symptoms**: Payment quote shows incorrect network
**Solutions**:
- Verify sandbox mode is enabled
- Check organization network configuration
- Restart PayGate with correct settings

### Insufficient Gas

**Symptoms**: Transaction fails in wallet
**Solutions**:
- Get more Base Sepolia ETH from faucet
- Increase gas limit if needed
- Try transaction during low network usage

## Moving to Production

When ready to switch to mainnet:

1. **Disable Sandbox Mode**:
   \`\`\`bash
   curl -X PUT "http://localhost:5000/api/organization/sandbox" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{"sandboxMode": false}'
   \`\`\`

2. **Update Wallet Configuration**: Set mainnet wallet addresses
3. **Test with Small Amounts**: Start with minimal USDC amounts
4. **Monitor Analytics**: Watch for successful mainnet transactions
5. **Scale Gradually**: Increase usage as confidence grows

## Security Notes

- Never use mainnet private keys on testnet
- Store testnet and mainnet wallets separately  
- Monitor both networks for unauthorized transactions
- Keep detailed records of all test transactions`

2. Configure endpoint:
   - Name: \`Get Weather\`
   - Method: \`GET\`
   - Path: \`/weather\`
   - Price: \`0.10\` (10 cents in USDC)
   - Network: \`Base\`
   - Origin URL: \`https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?q=London&appid=demo\`
3. Click "Create Endpoint"

## Step 3: Test Payment Enforcement

### 3.1 Test Unpaid Request
1. Copy the proxy URL for your endpoint (should be something like \`http://localhost:5000/proxy/org-id/service-id/weather\`)
2. Open a new terminal or use curl:
   \`\`\`bash
   curl -v "http://localhost:5000/proxy/[your-org-id]/[your-service-id]/weather"
   \`\`\`
3. **Expected Result**: HTTP 402 Payment Required response with payment instructions

### 3.2 Verify x402 Response
The response should include:
- Status: 402 Payment Required
- Headers with payment information
- JSON body with quote details including:
  - Price in USDC
  - Payment networks
  - Quote signature
  - Expiry time

## Step 4: Simulate Payment and Test Success

### 4.1 Mock Payment (Development Mode)
1. Note the quote ID from the 402 response
2. Make a payment simulation request:
   \`\`\`bash
   curl -X POST "http://localhost:5000/api/payments/simulate" \\
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \\
     -d '{
       "endpointId": "your-endpoint-id",
       "amount": "0.10"
     }'
   \`\`\`

### 4.2 Test Paid API Access
1. Use the simulated transaction hash from step 4.1
2. Retry the API request with payment proof:
   \`\`\`bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/proxy/[your-org-id]/[your-service-id]/weather" \\
     -H "x-payment: simulated_tx_hash_123" \\
     -H "x-payer-address: 0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0"
   \`\`\`
3. **Expected Result**: HTTP 200 OK with actual weather API response

## Step 5: Verify Analytics and Tracking

### 5.1 Check Dashboard Metrics
1. Navigate back to the Dashboard
2. Refresh the page to see updated metrics
3. Verify the following updated values:
   - Total Revenue: +$0.10
   - Total Requests: +2 (one unpaid, one paid)
   - Successful Payments: +1

### 5.2 Review Analytics Page
1. Go to "Analytics" in the sidebar
2. Check detailed metrics:
   - Request timeline showing your tests
   - Revenue breakdown
   - Conversion rates (should be 50% if you made 1 unpaid + 1 paid request)

## Step 6: Test Compliance Features

### 6.1 Set Up Geo-blocking
1. Navigate to "Compliance" page
2. Add a new rule:
   - Type: Geographic Restriction
   - Action: Block
   - Countries: Select a test country
   - Apply to: Your test endpoint
3. Save the rule

### 6.2 Test Geo-blocking (Simulated)
1. Make another API request with a simulated different location header:
   \`\`\`bash
   curl "http://localhost:5000/proxy/[your-org-id]/[your-service-id]/weather" \\
     -H "CF-IPCountry: [blocked-country-code]"
   \`\`\`
2. **Expected Result**: HTTP 403 Forbidden due to compliance rule

## Step 7: Test Escrow Functionality

### 7.1 Configure Escrow Settings
1. Go to "Settings" page
2. Set Escrow Hold Period to 1 minute (for testing)
3. Save settings

### 7.2 Test Escrow Flow
1. Make another paid request (following steps 4.1-4.2)
2. Navigate to "Escrow" page
3. Verify payment appears in "Pending" status
4. Wait 1 minute, refresh page
5. Payment should move to "Released" status

## Step 8: Test Advanced Features

### 8.1 Free Tier Testing
1. Configure free tier: 3 requests per 30 days
2. Make 3 unpaid requests to the same endpoint
3. On the 4th request, verify you still get 402 (free tier exhausted)

### 8.2 Multi-Network Testing
1. Create a second endpoint with Ethereum network
2. Test that payment quotes show correct network information
3. Verify analytics properly separate networks

## Step 9: Load and Stress Testing

### 9.1 Concurrent Requests
1. Use a tool like Apache Bench or curl with xargs:
   \`\`\`bash
   seq 1 10 | xargs -n1 -P10 curl -s "http://localhost:5000/proxy/[org]/[service]/weather"
   \`\`\`
2. Verify all requests return consistent 402 responses
3. Check that analytics properly count all requests

### 9.2 Payment Throughput
1. Simulate multiple payments rapidly
2. Verify payment verification doesn't become a bottleneck
3. Check that all payments are properly recorded in analytics

## Step 10: Production Readiness Checks

### 10.1 Security Validation
- [ ] All API endpoints require valid authentication
- [ ] Payment proofs are properly verified
- [ ] No sensitive data appears in logs
- [ ] HTTPS is configured (in production)

### 10.2 Performance Verification
- [ ] Response times are acceptable (<500ms for 402 responses)
- [ ] Payment verification completes quickly (<2s)
- [ ] Analytics updates in real-time
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended testing

### 10.3 Data Integrity
- [ ] Usage records accurately reflect all requests
- [ ] Revenue calculations are correct
- [ ] Escrow amounts match payment totals
- [ ] Compliance rules are consistently applied

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Payment Verification Fails
- Check facilitator configuration
- Verify network settings (sandbox vs mainnet)
- Confirm wallet address format

### Analytics Not Updating
- Check database connectivity
- Verify usage record creation in logs
- Refresh browser cache

### API Not Forwarding
- Test target API directly
- Check proxy configuration
- Verify endpoint URL format

### Compliance Rules Not Working
- Check rule configuration syntax
- Verify IP address detection
- Test with different headers

## Next Steps

After successful testing:
1. **Configure Production Settings**: Update wallet addresses, disable sandbox mode
2. **Set Up Monitoring**: Configure alerts for payment failures, high error rates
3. **Deploy to Production**: Use proper deployment process with environment variables
4. **Monitor Usage**: Watch analytics for real user behavior and payment patterns

## Automated Testing

For CI/CD integration, consider:
- Newman (Postman CLI) for API testing
- Jest/Mocha for unit tests
- Playwright for end-to-end web interface testing
- Custom scripts for payment simulation`

        title: "x402 Protocol Overview",
        summary: "Deep dive into the x402 payment protocol and how it works",
        seoDescription: "Complete guide to the x402 payment protocol - quotes, verification, settlement, and HTTP 402 payment flow.",
        content: `# x402 Protocol Overview

The x402 protocol extends HTTP with payment capabilities, allowing APIs to require payment before processing requests. This protocol enables seamless micropayments for API access.

## Protocol Flow

The x402 protocol follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Quote Request** - Client makes API request without payment
   - Server responds with HTTP 402 and payment details
2. **Payment** - Client sends payment to specified address
   - Blockchain transaction provides payment proof
3. **Verification & Access** - Client includes payment proof in retry request
   - Server verifies payment and processes original request

## HTTP 402 Response

When payment is required, PayGate x402 returns an HTTP 402 response with payment details:

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
x402-price: 0.01
x402-currency: USDC
x402-network: base
x402-chain-id: 8453
x402-address: 0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0
x402-quote-id: quote_abc123
x402-expires: 2024-09-14T10:30:00Z
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Payment required",
  "amount": "0.01",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "network": "base",
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0",
  "quote_id": "quote_abc123"
}
\`\`\`

### Response Headers

- **x402-price**: Payment amount required
- **x402-currency**: Payment currency (typically USDC)
- **x402-network**: Blockchain network (base, ethereum)
- **x402-chain-id**: Numeric chain identifier
- **x402-address**: Payment recipient address
- **x402-quote-id**: Unique quote identifier
- **x402-expires**: Quote expiration timestamp

## Payment Verification

After making payment, clients include proof in subsequent requests:

\`\`\`
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
x-payment: 0x1234567890abcdef...
x402-quote-id: quote_abc123

# PayGate verifies payment and forwards request
# Returns actual API response on success
\`\`\`

### Payment Proof Types

- **Transaction Hash**: Blockchain transaction ID
- **Facilitator Receipt**: Payment service confirmation
- **Signed Message**: Cryptographic payment proof

## Facilitator Integration

PayGate x402 supports multiple payment facilitators for verification:

### Coinbase Commerce
Production-ready payment processing with full blockchain verification.

### x402.rs
Native x402 protocol implementation with direct blockchain integration.

### Mock Facilitator
Development and testing adapter that accepts any payment proof.

## Network Support

PayGate x402 supports multiple blockchain networks with automatic configuration:

**Supported Networks:**
- **Base Mainnet** - Chain ID: 8453 (Production)
- **Base Sepolia** - Chain ID: 84532 (Testing)
- **Ethereum Mainnet** - Chain ID: 1 (Production)
- **Ethereum Goerli** - Chain ID: 5 (Testing)

## Error Handling

The x402 protocol defines standard error responses:

### Payment Verification Failed

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Payment verification failed",
  "code": "INVALID_PAYMENT_PROOF",
  "details": "Transaction not found or insufficient amount"
}
\`\`\`

### Quote Expired

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Quote expired",
  "code": "QUOTE_EXPIRED", 
  "details": "Please request a new quote"
}
\`\`\`

## Idempotency

PayGate x402 ensures request idempotency through unique request IDs:

**How Idempotency Works:**
1. Each request generates a unique request ID
2. Payment verification is cached by request ID
3. Duplicate payments are handled gracefully
4. Usage records prevent double billing

## Security Considerations

- **Quote Expiration**: Quotes expire to prevent replay attacks
- **Payment Verification**: All payments verified on-chain
- **Request Signing**: Optional request signing for enhanced security
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits per endpoint
- **Compliance**: Geographic and wallet-based restrictions
