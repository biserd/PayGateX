        content: `# About PayGate x402

PayGate x402 is a sophisticated payment proxy platform that implements the x402 payment protocol for APIs, allowing developers to monetize their API endpoints through automated micropayments.

## What is x402?

The x402 payment protocol extends HTTP with payment requirements. When an API endpoint requires payment, it responds with HTTP status code 402 (Payment Required) along with payment instructions. Once payment is verified, the request proceeds to the target API.

## Platform Architecture

**Payment Flow:**
1. API request ‚Üí PayGate x402 proxy
2. Check payment requirements
3. If unpaid ‚Üí Return 402 with signed quote
4. If paid ‚Üí Verify payment ‚Üí Forward to API
5. Return API response to client

## Key Features

- **x402 Protocol Implementation**: Full HTTP 402 payment protocol support
- **Multi-Network Support**: Base, Ethereum, and other blockchain networks
- **Real-time Analytics**: Comprehensive usage tracking and revenue reporting

    description: "Essential concepts for understanding PayGate x402",
    pages: [
      {
        slug: "x402-protocol",
        title: "x402 Protocol Overview",
        summary: "Deep dive into the x402 payment protocol and how it works",
        seoDescription: "Complete guide to the x402 payment protocol - quotes, verification, settlement, and HTTP 402 payment flow.",
        content: `# x402 Protocol Overview

The x402 protocol extends HTTP with payment capabilities, allowing APIs to require payment before processing requests. This protocol enables seamless micropayments for API access.

## Protocol Flow

The x402 protocol follows a simple three-step process:

1. **Quote Request** - Client makes API request without payment
   - Server responds with HTTP 402 and payment details
2. **Payment** - Client sends payment to specified address
   - Blockchain transaction provides payment proof
3. **Verification & Access** - Client includes payment proof in retry request
   - Server verifies payment and processes original request

## HTTP 402 Response

When payment is required, PayGate x402 returns an HTTP 402 response with payment details:

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 402 Payment Required
x402-price: 0.01
x402-currency: USDC
x402-network: base
x402-chain-id: 8453
x402-address: 0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0
x402-quote-id: quote_abc123
x402-expires: 2024-09-14T10:30:00Z
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Payment required",
  "amount": "0.01",
  "currency": "USDC",
  "network": "base",
  "address": "0x742d35Cc6639C443695aA7bf4A0A5dEe25Ae54B0",
  "quote_id": "quote_abc123"
}
\`\`\`

### Response Headers

- **x402-price**: Payment amount required
- **x402-currency**: Payment currency (typically USDC)
- **x402-network**: Blockchain network (base, ethereum)
- **x402-chain-id**: Numeric chain identifier
- **x402-address**: Payment recipient address
- **x402-quote-id**: Unique quote identifier
- **x402-expires**: Quote expiration timestamp

## Payment Verification

After making payment, clients include proof in subsequent requests:

\`\`\`
GET /api/data HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
x402-payment-proof: 0x1234567890abcdef...
x402-quote-id: quote_abc123

# PayGate verifies payment and forwards request
# Returns actual API response on success
\`\`\`

### Payment Proof Types

- **Transaction Hash**: Blockchain transaction ID
- **Facilitator Receipt**: Payment service confirmation
- **Signed Message**: Cryptographic payment proof

## Facilitator Integration

PayGate x402 supports multiple payment facilitators for verification:

### Coinbase Commerce
Production-ready payment processing with full blockchain verification.

### x402.rs
Native x402 protocol implementation with direct blockchain integration.

### Mock Facilitator
Development and testing adapter that accepts any payment proof.

## Network Support

PayGate x402 supports multiple blockchain networks with automatic configuration:

**Supported Networks:**
- **Base Mainnet** - Chain ID: 8453 (Production)
- **Base Sepolia** - Chain ID: 84532 (Testing)
- **Ethereum Mainnet** - Chain ID: 1 (Production)
- **Ethereum Goerli** - Chain ID: 5 (Testing)

## Error Handling

The x402 protocol defines standard error responses:

### Payment Verification Failed

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Payment verification failed",
  "code": "INVALID_PAYMENT_PROOF",
  "details": "Transaction not found or insufficient amount"
}
\`\`\`

### Quote Expired

\`\`\`
HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "error": "Quote expired",
  "code": "QUOTE_EXPIRED", 
  "details": "Please request a new quote"
}
\`\`\`

## Idempotency

PayGate x402 ensures request idempotency through unique request IDs:

**How Idempotency Works:**
1. Each request generates a unique request ID
2. Payment verification is cached by request ID
3. Duplicate payments are handled gracefully
4. Usage records prevent double billing

## Security Considerations

- **Quote Expiration**: Quotes expire to prevent replay attacks
- **Payment Verification**: All payments verified on-chain
- **Request Signing**: Optional request signing for enhanced security
- **Rate Limiting**: Configurable rate limits per endpoint
- **Compliance**: Geographic and wallet-based restrictions
