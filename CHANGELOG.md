# PayGate x402 Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.1.0] - 2025-10-01

### üéâ Major Features: Enterprise Provider Tools

This release introduces production-ready tools positioning PayGate x402 as enterprise-grade infrastructure complementary to Google AP2 and Stripe ACP, enabling API providers to monetize endpoints that power AI agents through blockchain-based micropayments.

#### Webhook System ‚úÖ
Real-time payment notifications with enterprise-grade reliability:
- **HMAC-SHA256 Signing**: Cryptographically signed payloads for secure webhook verification
- **Exponential Backoff Retry**: Automatic retry with 5 attempts (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, 16s intervals)
- **Event Broadcasting**: Triggers on `payment.confirmed`, `payment.failed`, `escrow.created` events
- **Delivery Tracking**: Complete logging of delivery attempts, failures, and success rates
- **Test Webhooks**: One-click test delivery for webhook validation
- **Organization-Scoped**: Multi-tenant webhook management with proper isolation
- **Comprehensive UI**: Create, manage, test, and monitor webhook endpoints

#### API Key Management ‚úÖ
Secure authentication system for API access:
- **Secure Key Generation**: High-entropy keys (`pk_live_*`) with 256-bit randomness
- **SHA-256 Hashing**: Keys hashed server-side, plaintext never stored
- **One-Time Display**: Full key shown only once at creation for maximum security
- **Prefix Display**: Shows first 12 characters for key identification
- **Revocation System**: Instant key revocation with timestamp tracking
- **Organization Ownership**: Cross-tenant protection prevents unauthorized key access
- **Usage Tracking**: Last used timestamp for audit and monitoring
- **Full UI**: Create, view, copy, and revoke API keys with secure display

### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Improvements

#### Database Schema
- Added `webhook_endpoints` table with HMAC secret storage
- Added `api_keys` table with SHA-256 hash storage
- Added `webhook_deliveries` table for delivery tracking
- Proper organization scoping for all new entities

#### Backend Services
- `WebhookService`: Event broadcasting, signature generation, exponential backoff retry
- `ApiKeyService`: Secure key generation, SHA-256 hashing, validation
- Storage interface extensions for webhooks and API keys
- Enhanced API routes with proper authentication and authorization

#### Frontend Components
- Webhooks page (`/webhooks`) with full CRUD operations
- API Keys page (`/api-keys`) with secure key management
- Updated navigation with new provider tool sections
- Enhanced error handling and user feedback

### üîí Security Enhancements
- Organization ownership validation before webhook/key operations
- SHA-256 hashing for API key storage (plaintext never persisted)
- HMAC-SHA256 signing for webhook payloads
- One-time display of sensitive credentials
- Cross-tenant protection across all provider tools

### üìö Documentation Updates
- Updated `replit.md` with Enterprise Provider Tools section
- Documented webhook system architecture and features
- Documented API key security model and usage
- Added comprehensive feature descriptions
